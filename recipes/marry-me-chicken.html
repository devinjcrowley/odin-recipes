    <h3>How to make Marry-Me Chicken</h3>
    <p>It’s a very easy recipe and requires less than 30 minutes of your time. So you can still make it even if a dinner date isn’t properly planned in advance as long as you have all of the ingredients.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken breast</strong>: sliced into cutlets</li>
        <li><strong>Flour, salt, and pepper</strong>: needed to dredge the chicken in flour for lovely golden and crispy crust</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil and butter</strong>: oil to brown the chicken, butter to taste</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: because it makes everything taste better!</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken or vegetable stock</strong>: chicken stock is best</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream and parmesan taste</strong>: for the best part—the rich, creamy, flavorful sauce (Do not use single or light cream, it won't thicken well)</li>
        <li><strong>Chili flakes, dried oregano, and thyme</strong>: extra flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh basil</strong>: for garnsih</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil and melt the butter on medium heat. Swirl pan to coat with oil and butter evenly.</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken (do not ovvercrowd and work in batches if needed) for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer onto plate, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Saute the garlic for a minute or until it's fragrant. Add the chicken stock and deglaze the pan, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Adjust the heat to medium-low, and add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes, thyme, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over pasta or rice.</li>
    </ol>
